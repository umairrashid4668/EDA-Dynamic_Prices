# dynamic_prices Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the `dynamic_prices` dataset using Python. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, focusing on data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights.

## Key Analysis Conducted

### Data Loading and Cleaning

- **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded using pandas, and initial exploration is performed to understand the structure and content of the data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values are handled, and any necessary data transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis.

### Summary Statistics

- **Numerical Features**: Summary statistics, including mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles, are calculated for numerical features.
- **Categorical Features**: Value counts are computed for categorical features to understand the distribution of categories.

## Graphical Analysis

### Numerical Feature Visualization

- **Histograms**: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of numerical features, helping to identify the range and frequency of values within the data.
- **Box Plots**: Box plots are generated to highlight the spread and potential outliers in numerical data.

### Categorical Feature Visualization

- **Bar Charts**: Bar charts are created to display the frequency of each category within the categorical features, providing insights into the most common categories.
- **Pie Charts**: Pie charts offer an alternative visualization to understand the proportion of categories in the dataset.

## Outcomes and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- **Category Distribution**: Certain categories dominate the dataset, indicating potential areas of focus for dynamic pricing strategies.
- **Price Distribution**: The distribution of prices shows skewness, with a concentration in specific ranges, which may indicate pricing trends or anomalies.
- **Outlier Detection**: Box plots highlighted several outliers in the pricing data, which could be investigated further to understand their impact on overall pricing strategies.

These insights can be used to inform dynamic pricing models and strategies, optimizing revenue and improving decision-making.
